<h2>Anchor Element Helps to Assign Attributes.</h2>

<h3>For example:</h3>

<a href="https://www.google.com">This is the google hyperlink.</a>

<p>In the above href is an attribute and google link is the value of the attribute.</p>

<p>The same attribute 'href' can also be assigned to one single word, for example, <a href="https://www.google.com">google</a>.</p>

<p>We can also assign drag as an attribute, for example, <a draggable=true href="https://www.google.com">google</a> link is draggable.</p>
