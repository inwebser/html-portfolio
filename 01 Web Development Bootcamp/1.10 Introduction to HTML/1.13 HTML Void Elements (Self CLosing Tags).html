<h1>HTML Void Elements or Self Closing Tags</h1>
<p>
    Non-void element means there is always something between the tags.
</p>
<p>
    Void element does not have anything in it except
    a forward slash right before the end of a tag. Non-void element has forward slash right
    after the starting of a tag.
</p>

<h2>For Example, let's use horizontal element hr to add a horizontal line:</h2>
<hr />

<h2>Or we can also use break element to break a paragraph, e.g.:</h2>

<p>
    By default, browsers separate paragraphs with a single blank line.<br />Alternate separation methods, such as first-line indentation, can be<br />achieved with CSS
