<h2>Direct the Computer to a Particular File or a Folder.</h2>

<h3>Two types of File Paths, viz, Absolute & Relative.</h3>

<ol>
    <li><h4>Absolute File Paths:</h4></li>
        <p>
            Path that is relative to the root of a computer, say,
            C drive in case of Windows. C here is the root directory.<br>
            E.g, C/Users/Junaid/Downloads/image.jpg<br>
            C is the root and image.jpg is the location.
        </p>
    
    <li><h4>Relative File Paths:</h4></li>
        <p>
            Path that is relative to the starting point, say,
            index.html
        </p>

</ol>

<h4>Examples of Relative File Path:</h4>

<ol>
    <li>If the file is in the same directory, use single dot forward slash (./):</li>
    <image src="./arm.png" alt="artisan concentration"></image>

    <li>If the file is in another directory, use double dot forward slash (../) to go a level up:</li>
    <image src="../1.20 Intermediate HTML/test.png" alt="artisan concentration"></image>

</ol>
