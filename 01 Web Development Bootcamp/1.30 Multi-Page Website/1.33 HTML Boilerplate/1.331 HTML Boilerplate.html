<h3>Doctype HTML.</h3>
<p>
    (HTML Doctype tells us the version the html file was written in.)<br>
    The structure is like this:
    <ol>
        <li>HTML tag where the code is written.</li>
        <li>
            Inside of the HTML tags are
            <ul>
                <li>Head element, where you include important information that is  not visible to a user.<br>For example, meta tag which takes care of character set like UTF-8 and website title.</li>
                <li>Body element, inside which all of the website content goes, like text, images, titles, links etc.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
</p>
